This app visualizes path finding algorithms and maze generators,

**_Performance issues may be present in larger screens_**

## Capabilities

### **Maze generation**

---

Can generate simple mazes both with animation enabled/disabled

Weights can be enabled/disabled before generation

### **Path finding**

---

Can find path from one point to any other point. Start/End position can be changed by selecting the current node and clicking on another target.

Dijkstra takes the weights into account (if there is no weights it will act like BFS )

### Flexible controls

---

Speed (of the path finding) can be changed in the middle of the run and also wall can be added or removed at the middle of the run.

**Adding/Removing walls in visited area will not the graph - meaning it can be broken**
